we added markdown editor from react-simplemde-editor
Make the SimpleMDE (Markdown Editor) match your dark theme — because by default, it comes with a white/light theme.

We got a problem on mark_down_editor which is not default black screen for making it dark we did this 
Created a custom CSS file → editor-dark.css
This overrides the default styles of SimpleMDE to make the background dark and text white.
Applied dark styles to:
.CodeMirror → the text editor box
.editor-toolbar → the toolbar above the editor
.CodeMirror-cursor → the blinking cursor
Imported that CSS in your component file so it gets applied when the component loads.


for form validation we used react-hook-form
this was our function before the react-form const NewIssuePage = () => {
  const { register } = useForm<IssueForm>()
  const [markdown, setmarkdown] = useState('')
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <TextField.Root placeholder="Issue Title"  />
      <SimpleMDE
        placeholder='Description'
        value={markdown}
        onChange={setmarkdown}
        options={{ autofocus: true }}
      />
      <Button>Submit Issue</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
